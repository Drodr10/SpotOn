# SpotOn

**SpotOn** is a peer-to-peer parking marketplace designed to alleviate the daily frustrations of campus parking. By connecting students, residents, and local businesses with drivers in need of a spot, we turn underutilized spaces into a shared community resource.

## 🌟 Project Vision
> For students who struggle to find affordable, reliable parking in Gainesville, the SpotOn is a peer-to-peer parking marketplace that allows users to reserve private driveways and local spots in advance for much less than commercial garages. Unlike SpotHero or ParkMobile, our product provides access to hidden inventory in residential areas, making parking more accessible and community-driven.
